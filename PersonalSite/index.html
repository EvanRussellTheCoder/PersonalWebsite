    <h1>Hi, I'm Evan, and this is my programming portfolio :)</h1>
    <hr width=750>
    <p>I am a person trying to get a Bachelors in CS from the University of Rhode Island</p>
    <p> In my free time I like to hang out with friends, make music, code for fun, exercise, and learn about the world </p>
    <p>I think that I would like to do web development for a career, at least in my junior dev years. It's fun and web developers seem pretty happy, so why not?</p>
    <h3>Ok enough with the introduction, I know you're proably here just to see if I'm good at coding or not, so here's some of my pretty work</h3>
